<h2>Principles</h2>

This is an index to my personal principles.

The principles are ordered from the more abstract to more concrete.

These principles are general - they could apply well in many universes, with many different kinds of actors.  These ideas are substrate independent.

<h4>Morality</h4>
<li>Kindness and Compassion</li>
<li>Generosity</li>

<h3>2 - Concrete</h3>

These principles are specific - they apply to our universe and the human condition.
