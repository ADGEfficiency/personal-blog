One of the most common misconceptions I hear about meditation is that meditation is about quieting the mind or stopping thoughts.

For a Buddhist, meditation isn't about control.  In fact, coming to realization that you aren't in control of your thoughts is one of the primary reasons for meditating.

Anattalakkhana Sutta
- second teaching
- analyzes each of the five aggregates, demonstrates they are impermanent and subject to suffering, and therefore not self
- Not-Self Characteristic Discourse

each of the personality-constituents 
- is outside of our control 
- brings suffering and 
- that each of the constituents is impermanent 

for all these reasons is lacking in self-nature

1. If anything were the self, then it would have two properties: it
would not be liable to disease, decay, destruction or change
generally, and it would be self-determining, i.e., it would have
complete control over itself.
2. But nothing in our experience has either of these two
properties, not the body, or feeling, or perception, or
consciousness, etc.
Therefore
 3. Nothing in our experience can be identified as the self.

the conclusion (3) cannot then amount to the unrestricted anatta doctrine according to which nothing at all is a self or has self-nature. It is one thing to say that nothing in our experience can be identified (veridically) as a self, and quite another to say that there is no self.

For it may well be that the existence of a (transcendental) self that is not experienced is a necessary condition of establishing that whatever is experienced is not a self. After all, if I come to see  that my body, feelings, perceptions, and so on cannot be identified as my very self, then it is presumably I myself who come to this insight. 

The gist of the control argument is this. There is no evidence of a self since nothing with which we are acquainted is immutable, and nothing with which we are acquainted is something over which we have complete control.

But this raises an obvious question: Isn't the standard for selfhood being set unattainably high?  The argument isd tantamount tosaying that if I am not God or a god, then I am not a self.  Arguably, God to be God must be impassible; but must a self to be a self be impassible?

No self argument
1. self would be unchanging and self-determining
2. nothing has these properties
3. nothing is a self

Thesis of the article is that 1 is inconsistent with 3
