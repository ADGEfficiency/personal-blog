dependency

specialization of a project simplifies the code - generalization makes code bases hard

If you want to extend the code and try out new things, I recommend modifying the code and trying it out to solve a specific new environment, and not try to improve the code to work for multiple environments at the same time. I find that for research work, and when trying to solve difficult environments, specific custom modifications are usually required. You are welcome to submit a pull request with a self-contained subdirectory that is tailored for a specific challenging environment that you had attempted to solve, with instructions in a README.md file in your subdirectory.
