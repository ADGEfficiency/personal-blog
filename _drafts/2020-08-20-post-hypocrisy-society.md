Alan Watts taught me to be aware of the influence of your own culture.

In the West, common assumptions make include:

- things should be fair
- the economy should always grow
- popularity is valued
- rationality is valued
- population growth can't be limited
- hypocrisy is not OK

Many of these assumptions are so taken for granted that we are not aware we are making them.

Hypocrisy is the focus of this essay.  Before looking at hypocrisy, let's first discuss where these assumptions come from.

## Biological & cultural
 
Let's propose that these assumptions arise from two places - biological and cultural.

Biological assumptions would be the most general, and apply to all human societies.  They come from natural selection.  These assumptions improve the probability of success at the game of evolution.  Biological assumptions apply to the entire species.

Cultural assumptions are more specific, and arise from specific experiences by groups of people (not all people).  The lessons learnt by earlier generations are passed on through stories, formal education, institutions and their objectives.  Cultural assumptions apply only to part of the species.

Further, more specific assumptions would be the value of freedom (especially strong in the USA), or perhaps the value of community in the East.

How then can you learn about what cultural assumptions you are making?

## The more different, the more useful

> Therefore, we have to find cultures which are in some ways as sophisticated as our own but as different from our own as possible.

Watts reccomends that by living in another culture you can better see what assumptions you take for granted.  I've found this to be in general true - larger differences also lead to more insight.

Now we understand that much of our worldview is not only biological but cultural, and that getting perspective on our own cultural assumptions can be done by living in another culture.  

We can now turn to the focus of this essay - the cultural assumption that hypocrisy is not acceptable.

## People shouldn't be hypocritical

The hypocrisy assumption is simple - we should practice what we preach.

Examples of hypocrisy include:

- 

I first noticed this assumption in listening to the debate of others.

[Reductio ad absurdum - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum)

The more formal version of the assumption is *reductio ad absurdum* (RAA).  An argument based on RAA is to disprove your opponent by showing their arguments lead to inconsistency.


## People are hypocritical

The logical truth of RAA can't be denied - showing hypocrisy is a logical way to refute an argument.

The problem is human beings show a fantastic potential for hypocrisy.  So often, we say one thing and do anther.

The truth is that we are all inconsistent.  Hypocrisy is illogical, but it is also human.


## Accept and work with it

My proposal is to accept, own and work on our hypocrisy.  There should be no shame in being hypocritical.

Currently, we do not accept the hypocrisy of others.  Any sign of it is cause for victory for the other side.  

So we are forced to hide it, not acknowledge it, not forgive others for it.  For something that we all do - because we work that way.

Accepting this has made life better.  It makes changes dealing with the inconsistency of others from a reason to attack to a reason feel compassion.


## The no-self connection

Hypocrisy aligns well with no-self.  How can you be consistent if there are many versions of your self.

Let's imagine you grow up unloved by a parent.  As a child, you swear to not repeat these mistakes.  Yet as an adult, you do.

Is this hypocritical?  If you see that person as one individual then yes.

Take this example and squeeze it down to a day.  One partner scolds another for having sugar in their tea - only to spend the morning eating a stash of Tobelrone.


## Sometimes, hypocrisy is optimal

You may not agree with the above - so be it.  Enjoy the next time you punish yourself and others when you catch them being hypocritical.

However one specific form a hypocrisy that without a doubt is changing your mind based on changing conditions.  If we have experiences that lead to a logically consistent conclusion in opposition


## Hypocrisy should be forgiven

> Condem most in others what we fear in ourselves - Robert Prsig

Perhaps the most extreme examples of hypocrisy are in religious communities:

- [sexual abuse in the Catholic church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases)
- [anti-gay rights advocates being homosexual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Haggard#New_Life_Church)
- [sexual abuse by a Zen monk](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/12/the-zen-predator-of-the-upper-east-side/383831/)

There are undoubtely examples in every religious tradition throughout the ages.  This is because it is a human problem - every person battles with hypocrisy.


## Taking this into your own life

Hypocrisy is usually a bad thing - and showing your opponent is inconsistent (using a tool such as RAA) is a vaild way to disprove their claim.

What, however, is not OK is cruicifying others for being hypocritical.  This is a human fault we all share.

> All of us need to be liberated from our culture to a certain extent, because education is a kind of necessary evil. And when the process of education—or acculturation—has been completed, we need a cure for it. Education is like salting meat in order to preserve it for eating. But when you’re ready to cook it and eat it, you need to soak some of the salt out. So in the process of being brought up by one’s parents and one’s teachers you are in one way spoiled—although, in another way, made tolerable to live with. And so in our culture it’s increasingly fashionable to have psychoanalysis when you’re finished with education, so as to work out and resolve all the damage and traumatic shocks that were done to you in the process.
