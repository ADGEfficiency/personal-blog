Vim

Don't show everything - just a few things I like (at a range of difficulties)

- top and bottom of file
- macros
- deleting inside brackets

Value of having same dev environment on remote servers

Use of cheat sheet

Have some way to combine topics (DQN, TRPO etc) into higher level notes (rl) - just by joining files together (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wh_WGWii7UE)

use of aliases

Having the abiolity to preview markdown in github on private repo, before posting to blog (benefit of using md)

idea of mixing in actions with notes + a traditional TODO list

bash scripts that finds all the TODOs

vim + tmux + fzf

1. better for coding
2. only way to work with long running ml experiments on remote servers (or screen)
3. seamless development environment between local and remote server

Key is the importance of the remote server

way to grab all of the high level summaries

the new idea is to put your actions in notes

plus

put the high level summaries into notes

this allows you to avoid having lists of important books - just mark a book important by putting the high level summary in the note!
