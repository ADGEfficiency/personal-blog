I have multiple projects at different stages

energy_py at the **talk** stage
world models at the **read** stage

Being able to interchange between projects (both the CONTENT and the WORK) is nice

ie being able to take a break from coding on one project to reading about another

multiple projects **open at the same time** - not sure if they need to be a different stages (but I think they are!)

pens = 0.2 or 0.3 thickness

local todo lists
