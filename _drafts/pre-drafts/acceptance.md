> “ No tree can grow to Heaven , ” adds the ever - terrifying Carl Gustav Jung , psychoanalyst extraordinaire , “ unless its roots reach down to Hell . ” 134 Such a statement should give everyone who encounters it pause . There was no possibility for movement upward , in that great psychiatrist’s deeply considered opinion , without a corresponding move down - PETERSON

> The past exists only in our memories , the future only in our plans . The present is our only reality - ZEN MOTOR

> The disadvantage to all this foresight and creativity is chronic unease and discomfort . Because we always contrast what is with what could be , we have to aim at what could be . But we can aim too high . Or too low . Or too chaotically . So we fail and live in disappointment , even when we appear to others to be living well - PETERSON

We don't know if an experience is positive or negative - only know instatnenous reward (see Manson how how to give fuck) - sometimes painful experience is most beneficial in the long term

‘To know that you don’t know - this is the beginning of knowing’

Struggles determine success.  Pain is important for wellbeing.

The psychology that evolution has given us makes us constantly unsatisfied in any situation.  The solution to this is acceptance.

# Acceptance

## Accept reality (stoic)

Quotes from Meditations

> The mind-training practices of the warrior present a fourth alternative, the alternative of an enlightened strategy - Pema Chodron

We must fully experience what we resist - investigation is our stragety.  We must come to know and accept our fears, our resentments and our shame.

Only by hearing and accepting the stories we tell ourselves can we see what affect they have on our bodies.  

All of our reality, positive and negative, glorious and shameful, deserve to be experienced as it is.  This is how we gain power over the negative - by accepting it.

Impermanence - perhaps the only truth in our world - must be accepted.  To not accept impermance means attachment, with which comes suffering.

## Accept failure

Not only should we accept suffering and failure - we should welcome it.  Evolutionary systems all survive and improve based on the failure of sub components. Your greatest failures become the most important and positive experiences of your life.

Your flaws allow you to improve.

Failure is a key ingredient in evolution - the process that has driven all biological and technological progress.  It's only by things failing at a lower level that the higher level can improve. 

Cells and the body.  Startups and the economy.
