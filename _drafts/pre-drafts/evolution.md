Evolution is progress through pain.  Morality is the abscence of pain.

Evolution is progress through separation.  Morality is feeling yourself and your surroundings as one.

Evolution is competition.  Morality is generosity.

> Nature is not simply dynamic , either . Some things change quickly , but they are nested within other things that change less quickly ( music frequently models this , too ) . Leaves change more quickly than trees , and trees more quickly than forests . Weather changes faster than climate . If it wasn’t this way , then the conservatism of evolution would not work , as the basic morphology of arms and hands would have to change as fast as the length of arm bones and the function of fingers . It’s chaos , within order , within chaos , within higher order . The order that is most real is the order that is most unchanging — and that is not necessarily the order that is most easily seen . The leaf , when perceived , might blind the observer to the tree . The tree can blind him to the forest . And some things that are most real ( such as the ever - present dominance hierarchy ) cannot be “ seen ” at all - PETERSON

replication, variation, and selection

As noted by Daniel Dennett, “evolution will occurwhenever and wherever three conditions are met: replication, variation (mutation), and differential fitness(competition)” [34]; no particular molecule (e.g. DNA or RNA) or substrate (e.g. specific physicalembodiment) is required
