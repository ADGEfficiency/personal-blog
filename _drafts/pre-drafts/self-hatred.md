I first noticed 

This document is me trying to figure this out.  I'm going to separate this into two sections - first general self hatred that appiles to large groups, and then the narrower self hatred that applies only to me.

## General self hatred

### Evolution (read nature) is immoral

### Self appointed judgement of the human race

## Personal self hatred
