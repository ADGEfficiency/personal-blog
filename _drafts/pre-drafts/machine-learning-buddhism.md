introduce 
machine learning = employed as data scientist,
buddhist = been to bodh gaya, lumbini, lhasa, seen the Dalai Lama three times - can medidate for almost one and a half breaths

1 - .self vs .no_self

2 - benefit of work shouldnt be in recieving reward

3 - cruel to make machine with a (false) sense of self
you can learn to program - you cant learn to be a buddhist.
can learn to understand - but you cant learn to accept

1 = you can learn to program
given (time, intellectual confidence, motivation, the machinery)
time  = versus time left in career
machine = nueroplastiicity + textbooks

if you have those 4 things, you can learn programming

can replace programming with math, languages. guitar etc

2 = you cant learn to be a buddhist

what do i mean by buddhist
here we are defining bddhist in the same way we would defince nomenclature
1 - philosophy
 constant questioning (buddha says dont take anything only based on his words)
  can take or leave what you want. 
  also nice for the scripture - you dontt need to accept it all, or have read it all.  buddhist canon

  ie 8 gossip for 8 fold noble path

  2 - compassion

  3 - theory
   three aspects,
    4 noble truths

    1 - impernance
    2 - duhhka
    3 - no self
     
     -----------------------------------------------------------------
     there is no .self - but there is a me()

     self is a function, a constant redefinition.  selfis not an object, its a process or function

     working with neural networks - you start to see your brain as a machine.  and this is helpful because you can start to see that these parts of your brain, the networks that is creating this unskillful thought is not you - its a machine

     why buddhism is true - dynamics of the mind are well captured by a modular model

     this works with the buddhist view of no self - no central or singular self can be found in the mind.
     closest thing would be an algorithm that determined which module is in control.  but you dont choose this - you dont conciously choose to be scared - to have feelings.  and feelings are closely associated with whihc module is currently activated.  Idea that emotions are to activate and coordinate the modular functions.  and this activation is no doubt ooptimized for Darwinian survival 

     buddhist solution to this is observation - observation of feelings allows you to keep emotion from taking control of your concious experience.  

     buddhist topught and modern philiosophy converge on this point - there is no one concious self - rather a series of selves take trns siezing control and running the show through feeling and emotion

     no self != no self responisibility.  even if there isnt a self that doesnt mean you dont have a responsibility to life your life to the fullest.

     discount rates

     in an MDP - discount rate is assumed constant.  But we as humans have variable discount rates.  LOC 1416.  Showing men pictures of woman they find attractive, the rate at hwihc they discount future cash flows changes.  Less willing to forgo cash in the near term for a bigger amoutn down the road (discount rate increased)  

     perhaps suggests that a higher level of agent would

     analogy with discount rate in reinforcement learning
