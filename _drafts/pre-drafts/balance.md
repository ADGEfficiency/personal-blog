Rather than search for growth, search for balance

Ideal = diversity + balance


## Diversity

The most tragic effect of climate change is a loss of diversity


Diversifying in finance


Maximum entropy


Talk in hypocrisy about more different culture more useful to learn from

Imagine a system where instead of cultural differences dividing  us, we protected other cultures because we only understood ourselves through them.


## Balance

Sustainability
