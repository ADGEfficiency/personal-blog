# A Personal Prayer of Loving-Kindness


## How To Use These Prayers

One form of loving-kindness meditiation is to wish happiness towards:

- yourself,
- then to someone you love,
- then to someone you dislike,
- then to all living things

These two prayers (the short & long version) can be used in this way - for example:

- "May I Be Safe, May I Be Happy ..."
- "May They Be Safe, May They Be Happy ..."
- "May All Living Things Be Safe, May All Living Things Be Happy ..."
