## Learning to know how it’s done - not to be able to do it

In my first year as an engineering student we learnt how to do engineering drawing by hand.  Drawing by hand is not something that any modern engineer spends time doing - thats what CAD is for.  

Yet the benefit of learning how to draw by hand wasn’t so that we could draw - it was so that we could understand how drawing was done.  

This is also true for discounted cash flow modelling.  Early in your career, take the time to build a few of these models.  Then later on you can get someone else to do it, but still understanding a) whats going on and b (and maybe more importantly) notice mistakes!  

## Going beyond your required level to make your level easy / Practice at a higher level than you play at

Most engineering degrees contain significant amounts of mind bending mathematics.  This maths is beyond what is required in many engineering jobs.  The value in pushing yourself beyond and into the realms of double integrals isn’t to actually be able to do them day to day.  

The value is that going back down to doing algebra or simple calculus (which is actually required day to day as an engineer) becomes very easy.  

By pushing yourself to a level beyond what you need to be, you end up being almost flawless at the lower levels.  And it's the lower levels where most business logic and value sits.

- doing calc at uni means algebra and first order derivatives (which is all I need day to day) are easy
- train with the first team, play with the second
- doing things to get an appreciation of how they are done (not to do them) - ie managining data scientists etc (this is a related idea) one works within a single skill, other across skills
- be the dumbest person in the room

## What you hate doing might be the most valuable

Two examples of this from my study.  During both my undergrad and masters I absolutely hated programming - its now something I do every day and really enjoy.  The intellectual challenge of programming is one of the purest and rewarding things I do.  

The second came during my masters.  A lot of our course focused on the mathematics behind optimisation algorithms.  Again - I hated it.  Yet applying optimisation to the operation of combined heat and power plants was one of the most profitable things I’ve done in my career.  Gradient based optimisation also forms the basis of the majority of modern machine learning - something which I’m using almost every day. 

Perhaps an intense dislike for doing certain kinds of work is a signal that this work will be valuable in the future?

## Take advantage of the curse of knowledge when you don’t have it

I’m lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to teach reinforcement learning at Data Science Retreat in Berlin.  I’m not an expert in reinformcent learning, and probably never will be.  But because I can remember what it felt like to have no understanding of the field, it’s actually easier for me to understand what my students might be struggling with.  

If you are starting to get an understanding of something, one of the best things to do is to teach it.  Not only to improve your own understanding, but because you are in a unique position to be able to relate to your student.


Also applies to energy_py - take advantge of the fact that peopke are using/looking at what you have built - change the API / design to be the best long term.  

Take advantage of having a small enough code base that you can manage it all
