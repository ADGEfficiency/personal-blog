Breaking down large projects into smaller tasks (Switch review)

###Â Single pointed focus on a group of interrelated projects is the ideal 

Lessons learnt in one project flow into another.  The desyncronization of project process (from initial stages to later stage development) means that lessons learnt in experimentation in one project can be applied into another.

Early stage projects will have less constraints -> eaiser to experiment.

Evolution makes good use of allowing many parallel experiments.

## work 7 days a week (or aka think 7 days a week)

- same hours
- you understand when you are asleep (exp replay)
- not always possible

## Don't be attached to the results of your work

The privilege and honor of doing the work itself is the reward.

> You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself - without selfish attachments, and like in success and defeat - BHAGAVAD GITA
