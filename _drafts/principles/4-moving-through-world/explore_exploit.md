## Choosing what to read

One application I’m interested in currently is in choosing what to read.  The younger you are it makes sense to read widely.  As you grow older and start to get an understanding of what books you enjoy or find useful, it makes sense to read similar books, books by the same author or to actually read those books again.  

We really don’t remember a lot of what we read once.  

One pratical application of this is to choosing what to read.  It makes sense to read more widely when you are younger (as you don’t know what books you like) and then as you get older to focus on the genre or even reread books that you found valuable.  The lessons in a book are usually understood when one is reading it but rarely full remembered - reading it again gives you another chance use the lessons in your life.  

This ability to actively tune this factor (similar to tuning the epsilon decay schedule in reinforcement learning) as your life progresses is not immediately obvious - neither is the value of adjusting it.
