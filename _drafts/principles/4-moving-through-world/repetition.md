## repetition

Repetition is the practical lesson from evolution. Understanding requires repetition.

Musk - quote about getting economy scale from iteration over design (rather than by factory size)

Page 219 of principles (clearing your head can be the best way to make progress)

You will never do something once - helps with perfectionism (ie it doesnt need to be perfect bcuase you will rebuild it)

## constantly reinvent yourself

Every time Picasso felt comfortable, he changed styles completely.

## welcome volatility

Donâ€™t expect every book you read or event you attend to revolutionise your life
same with going to talks
role of voalility ing rowth of biological systems

Volatility and stress (aka painful feedback aka failure) is requried for growth

idea that the biological is the always imperfect(ie genetic algorithms don't know when to stop, unlike derivative methods which get info about 1st/2nd derivative), mechanical is the perfect

Repetition allows volatilty to improve things

### give things chances

I hated Pink Floyd when I first listened to them.  The Beatles did nothing for me when I first heard Sgt Pepper.  Only after multiple listens does the music start to make amazing sense.

Your first impression of almost anything is might be incorrect.  Your first impression of something is unlikely to be a good representation of how you could ultimately feel about it.  

### Your first draft will be shit

All my work benefits from repetition.  Going in with the knowledge that your work you are doing now will be wiped and repeated allows you to look for things you can't figure out how to change, but that don't feel right.

Being able to recongize the poorly implemented part of your work and deliberately choose to ignore them is a key weapon in fighting perfectionism.

### The value of space

After spending four years working at ENGIE, I took six months to travel through Nepal, India and China.  One of the most surprising features of this trip was what my subconscious did with the spare capacity suddenly available to it.

No longer was my mind (or parts of my brain) working on emails, scheduling and meetings.  The spare mental capacity was filled with what ended up being my next direction - a transition into data.

Another example of the value of space is a blank piece of paper.  A blank piece of paper offers oppourtunities that a half filled page doesn't.  

Why is this in the section on repition - because sometimes you need to start over from scratch.  Don't constrain yourself with your previous draft, script or life.  Give yourself space.

### The value of a different dimension

By dimension I mean the space over where infomation is represented.  Take a photo of a sunset.  The photo can be represented in a high dimension as pixels (height * width * number of color channels).  This same photo can represented on a lower dimension as a caption of the photo (sunset in ).

This idea of changing dimensions can be brought into our daily lives.  Writing on a whiteboard is a fundamentally different experience than writing in a notebook.  Sometimes using a different medium can allow a different understanding to arise.
