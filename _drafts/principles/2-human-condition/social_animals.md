## Aligning incentives is important but will not guarantee results
There is no doubt that aligning incentives is a great.  I’ve personally witnessed a massive difference in the performance of my colleagues who were incentivised in different ways.  For example, some site managers would have their bonuses aligned with the energy cost of the site.  Other’s were judged on O&M costs.  Both led to different outcomes.  

The idea of aligning economic incentives is a simple one yet it’s not widely practiced in industry.  Yet only aligning incentives won’t guarantee results.  

But economic incentive is only one motivation behind action.  There are a multitude of other influences that determine behaviour.  The relative effects of all of the influences is variable across people, or even across a single persons lifetime.  If economic incentives were all that mattered then we would find that markets were rational.  In reality both people and markets are often irrational with respect to their own financial interests.

I think this principle applies to the clean energy transition.  Clean energy technologies are showing impressive cost improvements.  In a world with rational economic actors this would be the only thing that mattered.  

## politics (is this moral????)
The politics I am interested in is the everyday practice of compassion and kindess towards myself and others.

The dilemmas in modern politics are simple:
Tax more = less efficient economy, more equity
Tax less = more efficient, less equal

Permanent growth is stupid.  Both in terms of population and economic growth.  Our inability to stop the former and our lack of ability to stop obsessing over the latter are massive problems.
