### Your brain is a machine

In Why Buddhism Is True talks about how the role of feelings in our life is the way it is because of evolutionary pressure.  

Your brain is a machine.  One of the interesting side effects of using neural networks in my work is to start to appreciate the modular and mechanical nature of our brains.  

Three of the most popular modern neural structures are feedforward, convolutional and recurrent (specifically the long short term memory (LSTM) implementation).  This implies hat this kind of division of labour occurs within the structure of our own brain.  The alignment of this with the Buddhist idea of no-self is one of the ways in which this ancient idea is worth contemplating.  

## Perception

Perception is an active, not a passive process, a process of **constantly building models of the world**  (Chapter 10 of Wright)

everything can be looked at as dimensionaity reduction

ie cat image to cat label

ie raw document storage to actionable insights

this blog post is a dimensionality reduction from 10-20 books, ** talks, ** podcasts into a single blog post

## Memory

memory is generative - brain stores a low dimensional represntation of the memeory and recalls and processes this.  likely that the generation process is noisy, and may lead to wrong memoires

also idea that brain generates false memories if the experience its learning from are too differnet (this is from manson again page 128)

Brain tries to interpret new experiences to cohere with our previous experience.  When we experience things that don't cohere our brain generates experience and links it to our current experience (where does this come from?)

world models uses generated expt to learn from

see Mark Mason for (mind generating experience - false memories)

One really interesting modern psychological insight is the generative nature of memory.  This has a parallel with a powerful class of machine learning model - the generative adversarial network (GAN).  GANs improve the generative ability of one neural network using by a discriminator network.  I’m not suggesting memory is adversarial - but it certainly seems to be generative.  

The generative nature of memory would give a storage benefit (the memory can be stored as a lower dimensional representation) and also might help people to deal with traumatic events by generating a memory that helps us survive.

This psychological reality is shown in The Soprano’s.  Tony often mistakenly recalls events in his life when talking to his psychiatrist (and not just when he is trying to impress her).  

## Modular mind

Brain designed to fool
Because modules are in control

Feelings used to control

Fighting back = awareness & acceptance of feelings

Find your hidden motives by
