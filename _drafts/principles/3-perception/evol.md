# Evolution - the driving force

> What does it take to be a craftsman? It takes time. It takes experience. It takes mentoring. And, it takes a lot of trial and error. In our industry the best, and possibly the only, way to refine your skill is to make lots and lots of mistakes; and to learn from others who have made lots and lots of mistakes. So thank goodness for those mistakes, and thank goodness for the people who made them. Without them, we’d have learned nothing. And especially thank the people who were willing to expose their mistakes to the world.

Evolutionary learning is the driving force in our universe.  At the heart of evolution is a paradox - that failure at a low level leads to improvement at a high level.  Examples include:
- biology = survival
- business = money
- training neural nets using backpropagation = error / residual
- personal growth

There is so much to learn from this evolutionary process:
- failure at a low level driving improvement at a higher level
- the effectivness of iterative improvement
- the requirement of a dualistic (agent and environment) view

Evolution is the successive application of a generate, test and select loop.

## Generate, test & select

Evolution is progress via testing

Testing is competiting to infulence the future

Evolution is iterative improvement using a generate, test, select loop:

```
for generation
  generate 
  test
  select
```

### Generate

> [Instead of just picking the best option, I try to invent new ones](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/stepback)

In the **generate** step a population is generated, using infomation from previous steps.

### Test

Life comes with no instruction manual - the test is survival.

High quality error signals (transparency & open-mindedness)
- admit mistakes

[Lean into the pain - Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/dalio)

```
The problem is that the topics that are most painful also tend to be the topics that are most important for us: they’re the projects we most want to do, the relationships we care most about, the decisions that have the biggest consequences for our future, the most dangerous risks that we run. We’re scared of them because we know the stakes are so high. But if we never think about them, then we can never do anything about them.

Dalio:
- nature gave us pain as a messaging device to tell us that we are approaching, or that we have exceeded, our limits in some way
- In other words, both pain and strength typically result from encountering one’s barriers. When we encounter pain, we are at an important juncture in our decision-making process

Yes it’s painful, but the trick is to make that mental shift. To realize that the pain isn’t something awful to be postponed and avoided, but a signal that you’re getting stronger — something to savor and enjoy. It’s what makes you better.

Pretty soon, when you start noticing something that causes you psychic pain, you’ll get excited about it, not afraid. Ooh, another chance to get stronger

The agile approach, however, is to do the opposite: merging hurts, so we’ll do it more often

the trick is not to run from the pain.
```

In the **test** step, the population interacts with the environment, and is assigned a single number as a score.  

## Select

In the **select** step, members of the current generation are selected (based on their fitness) to be used to generate the next step.

Make and remake decisions

## Low level failure, high level improvement
Pain/error used as a feedback signal for improvement

Evolution uses failure as a positive feedback signal.  This is the paradox of evolution - that failure is needed for success.

- if you aren't failing, you aren't improving
- struggles determine your success
- lifes greatest moments can be your most unpleasant

## Iteration

Anything that is cyclic -> improvement via iteration

Plan & expect to fail
- Fred Brooks - plan to throw one away
- expect failures

Repition and experimentation
- first draft is shit
- low cost experiments

## Immorality of evolution

Evolution uses competition for testing & selection.  This is the immorality of evolution - the violation of non-duality.
