# Simplicity

Simple and perfect are opposites
- quest for perfection is damaging

Is it good enough (depends on nature of the game (winner take all etc) and the incremental cost of improving)

## Defined by what we choose to reject / not to do

Rejecting nothing = no self identify.  The value of via negativa.  Rejecting nothing = accepting everything

Don't invent everything yourself.  know the 10-30% you need to do.

Easiest code to write is the code you don't write

Don't review entire textbooks (the perfectionist approach) - focus on what is most valuable

- Not every project will go somewhere.  My Evernote is littered with half written blog posts and ideas for projects.  You don’t need to finish them all - in fact I think failed and unfinished projects is a sign of the ability to prioritise.  

Simplicity is also a great principle in terms of what you own.  Owning less is cheaper (both to initially purchase and maintain), reduces your environmental impact and also is one less thing to be attached too.  

### a few great ideas 

A great life needs a few great ideas - not every great idea.  Every mentor has around three great ideas that they repeat constantly.  Bezos always talks about building a customer centric company, Musk often talks about the value of first principles thinking and Ray Dailo wrote two books focusing on the value of principles.

There is no pressure to come up with great new ideas every day.  In fact it's far better to find a few ideas and to repeat and refine them.  

So don't be afraid if you are repeating yourself!  Refine your message and use those converations to check that you are right.

### Knowing when to stop / being ok with not finishing everything

Dylan talks about this in that San Fran interview (lots of unrecorded songs).  Kind of like drafting really

Don’t be someone who knows something and gets nothing done.  You don’t need to know how everything works.  

Also that if knwoledge was enough then everyone would be a billionaire with perfect abs (Sivers) (does this go here?)

### Not throwing out all progress after making one mistake

ie on diet, one poor day doesn't mean another should follow.  Get back on the horse.

Just because yesterday went badly, today doesn't need to as well

### Consistency can be the enemy

Sometimes its better if things are less consistent, but better organised!! 

idea that structure and consistency will strangle you.  ie format for reviews of books.  some books lend themselves to a short summary + long notes, other just long notes etc

### Notes should be as small as possible

For years my approach to collecting and organizing notes was one of a hoarder - saving every pdf and document 'just in case'.

Now my philosophy is the inverse - the goal with taking notes is to summarize the key points in as few words as possible.

Don't worry obsseively about making sure you can access the raw material - likely you can find it in less than two minutes on Google.












### practical examples

Examples of the form perfectionist approach vs simple approach

(ie review entire book vs review 2 relevant chapters)

Jobs - a few weeks after returning to Apple, got rid of 70% of the future product pipeline

Easy to make things complicated

Systems have variables and rules that describe rate, state and behaviour
- number of variables
- linear vs non-linear
- predicability (determinsitc or stochatuc)
- does the system adapt and change to conditions around it

Simple
- few variables, simple rules, deterministic, non-adaptive

Complicated
- lots of variables with simple rules

Complex
- lots of variables, dynamic, non-deterministic, adaptive

Chaotic
- few variables, dynamic, non-deterministic, adaptive

Complicated product
- many interface components, control elements and steps
- system of many parts

Complex system
- many relationships, connections, workflows and paths
- a system of interacting systems

Feature creep causes complication

Sometimes difficulty and complexity is a good thing - slows people down from making mistakes
