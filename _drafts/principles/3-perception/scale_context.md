Scale = context

Happiness Design - importance of environment

### Principles that don’t scale

Skin in the game book (about political systems that dont scale)

Scale matters in organizations.  A system of government may be more or less effective at different scales.  (this idea comes from Taleb?)

### Emergence

Emergence is one of the most fascinating phenomena.  It’s the process of properties only occurring when a system gets to a certain size.  Timothy Geithner (former head of the ) talks about this in his autobiography Stress Test - 

Examples of other emergent phenomena are deterministic Newtonian physics emerging from stochastic quantum physics

### Environment matters

Walking past a pile of rubbish does matter.  

### Role of the unconscious in shaping our sensory input 

Sticking with the subconscious.  What our eyes get as input and our consciousness experiences will be different.  Most likely what we experience is a lower dimensional representation of what the environment sends us as input.  This is exactly what a convolutional neural network does - takes a high dimensional array.  This array is often five dimensional - height, width and three colour channels.  A convolutional neural network will take this array and reduce the dimensionality to one we care about - for example classifying the image or creating a caption for the image.  (Maybe draw this??)

Our subconscious however does receive this input - and I believe it uses it.  How then can we refer to ‘our’ subconscious?  We can’t even experience as it sees - only what it allows us to see.  The lack of control is one of the original arguments by the Buddha given in the Cula-Saccaka Sutra.  A parable is made between a King controlling his kingdom versus our inability to control any of the five aggregates (body, feelings, perceptions, thoughts or consciousness).  

Don’t confuse the scope of our attention with the scope of your unconsciousness attention & input.   Your subcinciouness does see the rubbish as you walk down the street.  It can see your messy desk.  Your conscious attention may not notice it but the effect is going into how your body/brain works. 

### Working with different formats

LINK - repition

One example of this is the use of a whiteboard versus paper for thinking.  Technically both offer the same tool - the ability to write and draw.  But you can’t stand back and look at a piece of paper.  This ability to physically interact with the medium you are using is important.  It does change the way you work.  

Another example of space is the empty page, the empty spreadsheet or the empty script.  Sometimes it’s better to just start from scratch.  You brain just works fundamentally differently when it can start without any constraint.  

## The value of space and starting again

In 2016 I took 6 months off to travel after 4 years of work.  One of the things that surprised me most about the first few months was the flood of new ideas that filled my brain.  This is the value of space - now that my brain wasn’t spending it’s time thinking about emails, meetings and engineering work it had the space to think about new things.  

My working process has this requirement to start again built in from the start.  I know that the first version will be completely thrown out.  It’s a cost of work - the first few drafts allow you to see what you need to do to structure your approach to a problem.  It’s just not possible to see the pros and cons of different structures before having a go.  It’s usually pretty simple after a second draft to see the broad solution to a problem.  

Along a similar to starting from scratch is the importance of drafting.  No project will be correct the first time.  It usually takes two or three attempts before you can see how to correctly structure something.  This is true in writing and coding.
