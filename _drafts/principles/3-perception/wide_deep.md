Policies in alpha go

Investing deeply into one thing rather than a range 

- allows deep experiences
- commitment gives freedom
- makes decision making easier
- allows focus

Another example of this idea is the choice to travel or settle down.  Both offer a unique set of experiences.  And who said unique experiences was the goal anyway?  

In life we often need to trade off between the two - trying a number of different things or spending our time with only a few.  

## Exploration vs exploitation

Another reinforcement learning concept that speaks to the wide versus deep idea is the exploration versus exploitation dilemma.  Do we trust what we think we know or do we try something new?  It’s a parameter that needs to be tuned when a reinforcement learning agent tries to understand the environment it’s being born into.  

The wide versus deep concept can illuminate the decisions we made in many different areas of our lives.  Perhaps the most obvious is the decision to travel or to settle down.  

## AlphaGo

AlphaGo addresses the wide versus deep problem directly.  By using a policy network to reduce the width of next possible actions and a value network to reduce the depth of search, AlphaGo is able to reduce an intractable search space by reducing the width and depth of the search for the optimal action.
