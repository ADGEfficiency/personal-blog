## Social hacks

Franklin’s opinion , asking someone for something ( not too extreme , obviously ) was the most useful and immediate invitation to social interaction . Such asking on the part of the newcomer provided the neighbour with an opportunity to show him - or herself as a good person , at first encounter .

Intellectual self confidence

Being correct versus being useful
- telling all kids they are smart
- maps are useful because they don't have all the detail

Less info is better is becoming a coer principle - and I want it to be one

Find your hidden motives by looking for negative/selfish motive taht align with your public ones

What you dislike/get frustrated by in others = what you disklike/ are frustread by in yourself

First draft helps to create boundaries to break a project down

Value of constraints on the creative process
- unix special notes in Kernighan.md

More info not always better
- tribe mentors (example of the horse betting)

Value of local notes (posit and A4)

Value of being to hand

Value of examining extremes as a logcial tool


# Structure

Interconnectedness, impermance (foundation)
Morality
No self (human condition)

Should look at books I liked - how are they structued?

Do they use examples, stories.  Where are the stories used in the chapter

TODO
- 48 Laws of Power
- sapiens
- why buddhism is true

 idea of the structure
 1. Situation (arguments from different perspectives)
 2. Solutions
 3. Links

For links - put at start
- ie for suffering section - say this note relies on the concept of noself, which is discussed here etc

Ideally want chapters to flow into each other

Problems with our memory (biased encoding etc)

# Content

## MORAL = how to move with yourself and others
- interconnectedness
- kindness & compassion
- generosity
- hard work

## HUMAN CONDITION = the reality of being human

## MODELS = patterns / mental models aka the reality of our environment
- cycles ?

## WORK = how to get stuff done 

Each builds on the previous - but not in a uniform way.  for example, evolution underpins multiple work principles, but no self might stand alone etc.

How should I deal with references?
- maybe link to a list of all the talks, books (part of a wider list too)

How to visualize connections? (2D)

“Once we appreciate the universality of the Darwinian perpesctive” (quote from BB -> evolution principle, also relevant to impermance)

“Arguments for 1/2 century” into repetition principle (also from BB)

dont force your groups of friends together

Interconnectedness - Break down artificial barriers between diverse life experiences so all moments enriched by interconnectedness

to add - idea of the battle between focus and multi-tasking

even with good focus you need to reivist soemthing multiple times.  if you are trying to multitask, you will need to revisit even mroe!

In 1989 some clever researchers tracked the eye movements of radiologists as they scanned chest images for signs of lung cancer.3 They found that even when the radiologists missed a cancerous lesion, their eyes had usually paused at the site of it. Part of their brain knew there was something there; it just didn’t percolate up into conscious knowledge. I think many interesting heretical thoughts are already mostly formed in our minds. If we turn off our self-censorship temporarily, those will be the first to emerge.Graham, Paul. Hackers & Painters . O'Reilly Medi
