Struggles determine success.  Pain is important for wellbeing.

The psychology that evolution has given us makes us constantly unsatisfied in any situation.  The solution to this is acceptance.

# Acceptance

## Accept reality (stoic)

Quotes from Meditations

> The mind-training practices of the warrior present a fourth alternative, the alternative of an enlightened strategy - Pema Chodron

We must fully experience what we resist - investigation is our stragety.  We must come to know and accept our fears, our resentments and our shame.

Only by hearing and accepting the stories we tell ourselves can we see what affect they have on our bodies.  

All of our reality, positive and negative, glorious and shameful, deserve to be experienced as it is.  This is how we gain power over the negative - by accepting it.

Impermanence - perhaps the only truth in our world - must be accepted.  To not accept impermance means attachment, with which comes suffering.

## Accept failure

Not only should we accept suffering and failure - we should welcome it.  Evolutionary systems all survive and improve based on the failure of sub components. Your greatest failures become the most important and positive experiences of your life.

Your flaws allow you to improve.

Failure is a key ingredient in evolution - the process that has driven all biological and technological progress.  It's only by things failing at a lower level that the higher level can improve. 

Cells and the body.  Startups and the economy.
