# Impermanace

Impermanence (Pāli *anicca*) is the foundational truth.  Nothing lasts forever, everything always changes, change is the only constant.

## Evidence of impermanence

Your body is impermananet - the molecules in your body are completely changed every 7 years.

Your brain is impermanent.  Neuroplasiticty.

Your personality is impermanent.  Today you are happy, tomorrow you are angry.  Which one are you?

## Sources of impermanence

> Once we appreciate the universality of the Darwinian perspective, we realize that our current state, both individually and as societies, is both imperfect and impermanent (Bach Bacteria)

The evolutionary systems (generate and test) that make our world are non-stationary.  They find local optima, exploit them until conditions change and the optimum moves.

A second source of impermanence is our constant drive for things to be different.  Adaptation is fundamental to our psychology.  Human beings are excellent at adapating to some kinds of change - the success in achieveing a goal quickly turns into wanting something else.  The human condition is one of always wanting things to be slightly different.

The biological need for improving our situation relative to others stems from the hyper competitive nature of our society.  All our intelligence derives from this competition.  The ego and concept of ‘me’ as separate from the rest of the world derives from this.

Our fight to outcompete our human brothers and sisters creates suffering.  Our desire to prop up the illusion of a separate self creates a false barrier and false construct of separation from the universe that doesn’t exist.

## Effects of impermanence

The truth of change means that permanent happiness isn't possible.  Even if you were to finally achieve a situation where everything was perfect, tomorrow it wouldn't be.  Impermanace causes suffering because perfect situations won't last.

The impermanent nature of our reality means that even if things were for a moment perfect, they won’t be tomorrow.

The second effect of impermanence relates to our idea of self.  Evolution has given us a strong sense of self - a dualistic way of looking at the world as me and everything else.  But if everything always changes, then the self also changes.  If the self changes, are you still the same self?

Our body is constantly regenerating and changing.  Our personality changes on the scale of seconds - we can go from being cheerful to being sad within a moment.  Which self are you - the cheerful self or the sad one?

The truth of change is not the only vector we can use to attack the idea of a separate, independently and inherently existing self.  But it is a foundational one.

## Embrace impermanence

The effect of the truth of change is that suffering is inevitable.  This is the First Noble Truth - the truth of suffering as fundamental to being human.  Overcoming the suffering driven by change requires us to embrace change, to expect and accept it.

The solution to unstatafactoriness is acceptance.  We need to learn to accept the world as it is.  Enjoy pleasure when it is here, don’t miss it when it is gone.  Accept suffering when it occurs, don’t miss it when it is gone.  Engage with the world as it is, not as you want it to be.

Great art is created by making friends with impermanence.  Bob Dylan and Neil Young embraced intentional change throughout their careers.

Moving to CHCH - stressful to think about it as a permanent move - instead think of it as a time to enjoy the city for a few years

## Not embracing impermanence

After living in Europe for almost a decade, thoughts of returning to New Zealand and settling down became a key factor in restlessness and unhappiness.  I was convinced of the benefits of stability and being in one place.  Isn't this idea in opposition to embracing the fact that everything always changes, and nothing stays the same?  Instead of enjoying wherever I was at the time, I was dreaming about tomorrow.
