<p>One feature of the human condition is a sense of self, based upon:</p>
<ul>
  <li>our body</li>
  <li>our story</li>
</ul>

<p>It is natural for us to feel a sense of self - it is part of the human condition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Thus, in the course of his life, one man acquires many personal qualities, many personages, many ‘I’s’ (because each, speaking for itself independently of the others says ‘I,’ ‘me,’ when it appears). Jean Vaysse, Toward Awakening</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s important to clarity is meant by self.  The naive reaction to no-self is nihilism - that the no-self argument is denying existence.  This isn’t what no-self means at all.  No-self denies the existence of a separate, inherently existing self.  The kind of self that exists independently of the rest of the universe, the kind of self that gives rise to a ‘me and them’ attitude.</p>

<p>To define our selves creates separation - me and then everything else.</p>

<h2 id="the-fundamental-mistake">The fundamental mistake</h2>

<p>So many problems arise from this sense of separation from the world.</p>

<p>This false sense of self causes suffering in many ways.  The most subtle is the difficulty we have of holding up the illusion.  We struggle to keep the story of our life consistent with the past because there is no past.  The past is gone, yet we cling onto it because we need to keep our sense of self alive.</p>

<p>Our sense of self creates temporal connections that don’t exist.  We think about past failures as our own.  In reality the person that made those mistakes doesn’t exist anymore.  They deserve our compassion, not our guilt.  This disconnection from the failures of your past and today allows you to feel compassion where naturally you feel guilt.</p>

<p>Our sense of self naturally brings about comparisons with others.  The success of our peers makes us feel bad when it should do the opposite.  There is no separation between us and others - the successes of others are our successes.  The pain of others is also our pain. Sharing success is metaphysical support for commitment to a kind life. Sharing pain is a metaphysical support for commitment to a compassionate life.</p>

<p>Our separate self causes suffering.  But is it real?</p>

<h2 id="there-are-many-selves">There are many selves</h2>

<p>Self manipulation, self control, talking to yourself, lack of ability to control / predict how you will feel etc</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="the-impermanence-argument">The impermanence argument</h2>

<p>The truth of impermanence means that an inherently existing, separate self cannot exist.</p>

<h2 id="the-control-argument---the-five-aggregates">The control argument - the five aggregates</h2>

<p>The second vector used to attack the self is that of control.  A useful concept here is the five aggregates, which are the body, our feelings, perception, thoughts and consciousness.  In (WHICH SERMON?) the Buddha systematically examined each of the five aggregates and asks the question - do you have control of this aggregate?</p>

<p>While we have influence over</p>

<p>Our illusion of control (of both internal and external) smashes into our massive lack of influence in the world inside and outside of us.  Our own subconscious hides infomation, biases the infomation we see and influences us using subtle feeling and emotion.</p>
