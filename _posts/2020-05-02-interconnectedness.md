excerpt: "The Spatial & Temporal Connection with Everything"

---

We live in one universe.  We all live in the same universe. We live in a universe where everything is connected.

The human condition gives an illusion of separation - this illusion exists only in our own mind.

## Physical connection

Take your body - it's made of atoms that were once plants.  You are built from the universe, inherently and inseparably connected to the environment that you live in.

Take your breath - a constant connection between your body and the environment.  Air that once yesterday floated miles above you enters your body and keeps it alive.  This air was as much a part of you when it was high above you as when it's inside your cells.

## Temporal connection

When were you born?  When you came out of your mothers womb?  At the moment of conception?  When the egg and sperm were created?

The first action of your existence was the big bang.  You are part of a process that started when everything else started.  You will continue to be part of that process well after you die.  Interconnectedness gives freedom from birth and death.

> If the cosmos exists, then the smallest spec of dust exists.  If the smallest spec of dust doesn’t exist, the whole cosmos doesn’t exist.

## Good and bad

Cherish both the garbage and the rose - one is made of and requires the other. 

## Their wins are your wins

You know the feeling you get when a friend succeds - that feeling of jealously?  This is a Darwinian, zero sum reflex - where the successes of others are bad for me - interconnectedness shows the folly of this position.  The successes of others are my successes, my losses are their losses.

Sharing happiness doesn't mean we have less of it - in fact sharing our happiness increases it.  Not only is their happiness my happiness, but sharing my happiness gives them more.  In this way interconnectedness is the metaphysical of generosity.

## Foundation of morality

> Training in morality at its best is grounded in a theoretical or direct appreciation of one more assumption, that of interconnectedness. Interconnectedness at this level means an appreciation of the fact that we are all in this together and that we all share the wish to be happy. When we take into consideration our own needs and the needs of those around us, we are more likely to be naturally kind and considerate of ourselves and others. Thus, we try to make it a habit to try to take into account the feelings, opinions and welfare of those around us. (mastering core teaching)
