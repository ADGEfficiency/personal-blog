https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism

conflict (disharmony) between
- human need (compulsion) for meaning
- inability to find it (inherently meaningless universe)

how to respond (counter) (Camus)
- suicide - only makes it more Absurd
- spiritual meaning - meaning beyond existence - requires irrational beliefs in intangibles
- acceptance 
- (oppourtunity to) develop meaning from the search
- absurd universe -> freedom

Camus
- embrace the meaninglessness
- rebel (defiant) in spite of -> contentment
- local meaning (death makes it ultimately meaningless)
- only ultimate resolution is death

> (Camus) defines the human condition as absurd, as the confrontation between man's desire for significance, meaning and clarity on the one hand â€“ and the silent, cold universe on the other

> In acknowledging the absurdity of seeking any inherent meaning, but continuing this search regardless, one can be happy, gradually developing meaning from the search alone.

origins in Kierkegaard (his response is existentialism)
- anticipated the Absurd, but from monothestic pov
- regards Camus solution as `demoniac madness`

existentialism, nihilism, Absurdism
- all three arise from human experience of the Absurd
- differ in their response
