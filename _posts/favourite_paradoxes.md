Your strength is weakness, your weakness is your strength

- The paradox of equality & freedom.
> Ever since the French Revolution, people throughout the world have gradually come to see both equality and individual freedom as fundamental values. Yet the two values contradict each other. Equality can be ensured only by curtailing the freedoms of those who are better off.


### Risk homeostasis

from Medici Effect review

Compensate for high risks in one area with low risks in another

Efforts to decrease risk (ie road safety) lead to riskier behaviour (dangerous driving)

Risk minimization at the intersection = not viable

- more money -> more spending
- more time -> take more time
- more contacts -> rely on them more

Doing more -> increases the risk of failure - we increase it to a level we are subconsciously comfortable with

This is kind of similar to Jenkins paradox!
