Incorporate graduate stuff

# Lessons I learnt in my twenties

## It's more important to get back on the horse than to stay on it

don't let failures snowball
- just because you failed yesterday, doesn't mean you should today
- recovering is something to be proud of

## Don't eat carbs

A turning point for me in my body composition was stopping eating carbs (rice, pasta, bread etc).  I have not cut these totally from my diet, but they now no longer form the basis of any meal.  They are a nice to have, not a foundation.

## Don't drink calories

## Don't force friends together

I'm lucky enough to have been a part of a few distinct friend groups from across the world.  I often thought about and looked forward to them meeting - surely if they are both friends of mine, they will get along immediately?

This rarely turned out to be the case.  Human social interaction (friendship included) is complicated.  

This doesn't mean that mutual friends of yours will never get along - only that this is not guaranteed.

## Life is meaningless

I'm currently an Absurdist - one who believes that it is absurd that man is born into this world with a desire for meaning, when this world is fundamentally devoid of inherent meaning.

This is a wonderful philosophy, because it means you can define your own meaning in life.  There is no right or wrong answer.

## Fear of being alone can keep a relationship going longer than it should


## Walking is good for the mind & body

Simplicity of only having to walk from A to B.

The human body is designed to walk long distances

## Space is good for the mind

You will be suprised at what your mind comes up with when not tasked with keeping track of everything assoriated with the professional life - emails, meetings and ! are replaced with thoughts of what you really want in life.

Value of a blank sheet of paper, small to large notebook

## Emotion is fundamental in decision making

The emotional context is a requirement, not a hindrance

Alcholic example

## Humans are hypocrites (and it's OK)

What you hate most in others, you hate in yourself

## The difference between travel, a holiday and sightseeing

But some sights are worth seeing.  Two of the most powerful experiences I've had are standing in front of religious monuments - St Peter's Basicilla & the Tomb of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama the most powerful.

## Other people are the key to happiness

Evolutionary advantage (requirement) of being part of a community to survive

Sense of belonging, acceptance, being able to help others

## Be comfortable (even welcome) imperfection

Become comfortable with imperfection - unfinished projects, messy notebooks, half finished reviews of textbooks, reviews of literature that only focus on the important stuff.  This is 80/20 in actionBe uncomfortable with your past failures and embarassements.  Not because they made you who you are, but because you are not that person anymore.Leonardo on unfinished projects - quote from Walter isssacson book

## The human condition is to constantly search for things to be unhappy about

Makes sense from a survival pespective - the content hunger gatherer is unlikely to be proactive

## Strength is your weakness, weakness is your strength

Big strengths often come with big weaknesses
